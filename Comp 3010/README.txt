These commits in this is solely for the eyes of my professor Matteo Cimini, 
although until i figure out how to make it private except for a select few 
people, or better yet make it public and block out anyone from seeing my 
code in the future, it'll be open to all. So all i have to say is Please 
dont plagiarize my code i dont want to be losing points because i couldnt 
figure out selective respository sharing


-----------------------2/25/21----------------------------------------
** added my current code for the bigstep interpreter which has the syntax 
   portion of testing done, but not the bigstep semantics done
   ** said test cases still needed to be finished and bug tested to work
      100% of the time

-----------------------3/16/21----------------------------------------
** some work done to make big step semantics work not all tests checked for sure.
      -- 1:38 something came up i had to do so i stopped testing to do that.
